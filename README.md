Coffee-Constructor

Nutrition Information is available from multiple popular coffee chains however there doesn't appear to be a unifying or
disprate contruction web app for building a coffee drink with a live nutrition calculator. The purpose of this app is to 
fill this niche with that audience in mind and using the public information parsed into a database for additional 
analytics and visualization. An example of the construction webapp is Chipolte's tool for building a burrito with such 
a live feedback of your nutritional choices.
